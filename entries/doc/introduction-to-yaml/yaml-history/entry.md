title: 1.2. YAML History

The YAML 1.0 specification was published in early 2004 by by Clark Evans, Oren Ben-Kiki, and Ingy döt Net after 3 years of collaborative design work through the yaml-core mailing list. The project was initially rooted in Clark and Oren’s work on the SML-DEV mailing list (for simplifying XML) and Ingy’s plain text serialization module for Perl. The language took a lot of inspiration from many other technologies and formats that preceded it.

The first YAML framework was written in Perl in 2001 and Ruby was the first language to ship a YAML framework as part of its core language distribution in 2003.

The YAML 1.1 specification was published in 2005. Around this time, the developers became aware of JSON9. By sheer coincidence, JSON was almost a complete subset of YAML (both syntactically and semantically).

In 2006, Kyrylo Simonov produced PyYAML and LibYAML. A lot of the YAML frameworks in various programming languages are built over LibYAML and many others have looked to PyYAML as a solid reference for their implementations.

The YAML 1.2 specification was published in 2009. Its primary focus was making YAML a strict superset of JSON. It also removed many of the problematic implicit typing recommendations.

Since the release of the 1.2 specification, YAML adoption has continued to grow, and many large-scale projects use it as their primary interface language. In 2020, the new YAML language design team began meeting regularly to discuss improvements to the YAML language and specification; to better meet the needs and expectations of its users and use cases.

This YAML 1.2.2 specification, published in October 2021, is the first step in YAML’s rejuvenated development journey. YAML is now more popular than it has ever been, but there is a long list of things that need to be addressed for it to reach its full potential. The YAML design team is focused on making YAML as good as possible.
