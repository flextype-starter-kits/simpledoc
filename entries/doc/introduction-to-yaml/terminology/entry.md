The rest of this document is arranged as follows. Chapter 2 provides a short preview of the main YAML features. Chapter 3 describes the YAML information model and the processes for converting from and to this model and the YAML text format. The bulk of the document, chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, formally define this text format. Finally, chapter 10 recommends basic YAML schemas.
